# UFOs

# Purpose
- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
- Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

# Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML, CSS, D3 

# Project Road Map
- Create ![data.js](https://github.com/sdang101/UFOs/blob/master/static/js/data.js) containing the list of data and ![app.js](https://github.com/sdang101/UFOs/blob/master/static/js/data.js) to create functions to select, filter the data
- Create an ![index.html](https://github.com/sdang101/UFOs/blob/master/index.html) with Bootstrap styling and CSS file (![style.css](https://github.com/sdang101/UFOs/blob/master/static/css/style.css))

# Result
![WebPage](https://github.com/sdang101/UFOs/blob/master/static/images/WebPage.png)

# Further Development
- data.js file other key values pairs that's not included in our filter data. I suggest adding "durationMintues" and "comments" to the filters on the site to give the user more information.
